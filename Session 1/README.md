# Session 1: What is an Online Studio?

Before we start building our own online studios, we have to manifest for ourselves what
these spaces actually should do for us and how they should look like.

For this, it's always nice to surf around the internet and collect a couple
of [URL](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)s that inspire you.

**Assignment**: Think about parameters for online studios and bring 1-2 examples to the excursion that come close to your vision of online studios (don’t need to be “online studios” as such, can also be artistic or simply technical examples)
 

Here are a couple of my own collections, which may be an interesting starting point for you. But you can obviously also look at how your favorite artists, museums and galleries are using platforms like instagram, tiktok and facebook to share artworks.
I like to use are.na because you can lose yourself following different connections and finding more (semi-)related links.

# Session 1: What is an Online Studio?

Before we start building our own online studios, we have to manifest for ourselves what
these spaces actually should do for us and how they should look like.

For this, it's always nice to surf around the internet and collect a couple
of [URL](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)s that inspire you.

**Assignment**: Think about parameters for online studios and bring 1-2 examples to the excursion that come close to your vision of online studios (don’t need to be “online studios” as such, can also be artistic or simply technical examples)
 

Here are a couple of my own collections, which may be an interesting starting point for you. But you can obviously also look at how your favorite artists, museums and galleries are using platforms like instagram, tiktok and facebook to share artworks.
I like to use are.na because you can lose yourself following different connections and finding more (semi-)related links. Clicking on any of the block reveals these other human made connections on the right side panel.

### Theory

I am very inspired by this text of Laurel Schwulst [My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)
If you like, you can read it and we can have a discussion on it.

Together with Elliott Cost, Laurel is also running [html.energy](http://html.energy/home.html). Some nice audio interviews on there.

Katherine Frazer took the ideas of the website as shifting house and applied them to her Ikebana practice. [Ikebana Tips for Software Design](https://ikebana.website/talk/2020/02/29/ikebana-tips-for-software-design.html)

During the pandemic ideas of the *personal wiki* or *digital garden* started to become popular (again?). In short, people are using websites and note taking apps to create linked ideas that they can use as reference. Tech review wrote about it here: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)

Behiye also mentioned [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) from Eric S. Raymond, which uses the architectural structures to describe ways of writing open source software.

### Git

Git is a software to track changes of any set of files. It was first created by Linus Torvalds (another icon of the open source world, as he created the Linux kernel) and is used by many developers and writers all over the world. Besides tracking the history of files, you can create new branches and go off to make multiple histories and colaborate with other by merging their writing with yours.

For now, we will be using a webinterface called Github, which is most popular and has been bought by Microsoft in 2018. Later we will synchronize what we have on github with a folder on our computer and edit it from there. For this we will need a Text Editor, you can get a little sneak peak when you go to your repository in the browser and press the `.` key.

With this editor in the browser you can easily edit and change files in your repo. Use it to add the assignment as a `.md` file.
MD stands for markdown, which is a way to format your text using *plain-text*. It uses characters to tell the computer which part is a Headline, or what is *italic* or **bold**. Github has a special flavor of markdown and you can find the syntax [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

If you want to take a deep dive into git, software studies and net.art here is a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knudcIamS8M&list=PLoQrXDiSBWYGFfbXdY55DfpyZyZavjSAz) from my favorite teache Nick Briz.

It seems that a lot of people also recommend [git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) to learn git. I worked for years, just knowing the very basics (git pull, add, commit, push) and this is really fine, if you work alone on your own projects :) So, don't stress yourself too much, it will come to you eventually.

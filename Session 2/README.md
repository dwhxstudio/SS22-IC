# HYPERTEXT

This week we will go back in time and use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http://) to publish documents which are described with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
Artists have been using Hypertext to tell intricate stories and play with expectations of computer users. These websites still work on modern browsers, so try out http://www.mouchette.org (1996) and  [My Boyfriend came back from the war](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/) (1996) to get some inspiration.
An example of a simple website that uses your browsers default style is here: http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ 

## Assignment

Create and publish your own Hypertext Studio. Use links, images, videos, audio or text to describe a current project that you are working on or tell us about your general art practice. Feel free to be creative and unconventional. It is ok if things don't work as expected or break.
